        1. **Identify all potential stakeholders**: Cast a wide net initially to ensure no important groups are missed.

        3. **Prioritize stakeholders**: Focus more resources on high-interest, high-influence stakeholders.
        4. **Tailor engagement strategies**: Different stakeholders may require different approaches.
        5. **Regular review**: Stakeholder dynamics can change over time, so review and update your plan periodically.
        6. **Be inclusive**: Ensure marginalized or less visible groups are not overlooked.
        7. **Document interactions**: Keep records of stakeholder engagements and feedback for future reference.
